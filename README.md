Ontario NORCs for 2021 Census

We will identify naturally occurring retirement communities (NORCs) in Ontario, Canada based on the 2021 census dissemination areas (DAs). For the 2021 census period, 5-year age groups from 0 to 99 years of age for male and female population; 100 years and older are grouped as category. Age-sex populations with <5 persons are reported as 5 persons. Percentages for elderly adults in the DAs are computed as the proportion of male and female populations who are aged 55 years or older from the total male and female populations in each DA. NORCs are considered any DA containing at least 40% of elderly adults.
